    Fix the concatenation of statistics in ``GraphRestrictedBoltzmannMachine.sufficient_statistics``.
    The issue was the concatenation of statistics were hard-coded at dimension 1 when it should have
    been the final dimension (to reflect that of ``GraphRestrictedBoltzmannMachine.interactions``).
