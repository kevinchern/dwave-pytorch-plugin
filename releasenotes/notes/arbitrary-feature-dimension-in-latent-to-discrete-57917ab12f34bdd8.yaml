    The default ``latent_to_discrete`` transformation in
    ``dwave.plugins.torch.models.discrete_variational_autoencoder.DiscreteVariationalAutoencoder``
    has been fixed to accommodate arbitrary encoders. Before, the default
    transformation only allowed encoders whose output shape was (B, l). Now,
    encoders can have an arbitrary number of feature dimensions, i.e., the
    shape can be (B, l1, l2, ...).
