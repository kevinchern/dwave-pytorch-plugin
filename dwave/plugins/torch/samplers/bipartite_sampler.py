class BipartiteGibbsSampler(TorchSampler):
    """A block-Gibbs sampler specialized for bipartite graph-restricted Boltzmann machines.

    This sampler exploits the bipartite structure of the underlying GRBM, in which
    nodes are partitioned into visible and hidden sets and there are no connections
    within the same set. Under this assumption, all spins in one layer are conditionally
    independent given the spins in the other layer. This allows the sampler to update
    layers simultaneously using block Gibbs updates.

    Each Gibbs step alternates between:
        1. Sampling visible spins conditioned on the hidden spins.
        2. Sampling hidden spins conditioned on the visible spins.

    The sampler maintains persistent Markov chains that are updated
    in-place whenever :meth:`sample` is called. These chains can be used both for
    unconditional sampling from the model and for conditional sampling by clamping
    a subset of spins.

    Args:
        grbm (GRBM): The Graph-Restricted Boltzmann Machine to sample from.
        num_chains (int): Number of Markov chains to run in parallel.
        schedule (Iterable[Float]): The inverse temperature schedule.
        initial_states (torch.Tensor | None): A tensor of +/-1 values of shape
            (``num_chains``, ``grbm.n_nodes``) representing the initial states of the Markov chains.
            If None, initial states will be uniformly randomized with number of chains equal to
            ``num_chains``. Defaults to None.
        seed (int | None): Random seed. Defaults to None.
